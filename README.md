## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 20 does your team deserve on this assignment. Revise the assignment grading guideline and assignment rubrics for guidance.
14. I thought I had the game Controller / index.js methods working well, but I keep getting some undefined results for the CPU. There will be instances where it works fine, and
instances where it won't. I also was unable to figure out how to clear the history log after each iteration.

## Team Reflection:
- Where did you encounter struggles today, and what did you do to deal with it?
for whatever reason, I had const userName = document.getElementById('username'); defined as getElementById('element'); which completely threw me off for a while until I managed to spot it. I also wish I had given myself more time to work on the assignment, because I definitely would have attempted the extra credit.

### How long it took us to finish this?
